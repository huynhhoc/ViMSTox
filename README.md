# ViMSTox – Vietnamese Middle School Toxicity Dataset

## Introduction
This repository supports the **design of survey instruments and data collection** for the master’s thesis of **Diep Thi Thanh Thao**, entitled:

> **RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF TOXIC LANGUAGE DETECTION MODELS FOR EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANT SYSTEMS TARGETING MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS**

**Supervisor:** **Dr. Huynh Thai Hoc**

This research introduces and progressively builds **ViMSTox (Vietnamese Middle School Toxicity Dataset)**, a dataset aimed at identifying **toxic, harmful, or inappropriate language** in the context of **educational assistant systems (chatbots) for Vietnamese middle school students (grades 6–9)**.

The overall objective is to support the development of AI models and mechanisms for **content safety in educational environments**, thereby reducing potential risks arising from interactions between students and intelligent learning assistants.
